## Handwritten letters classifier - March 2021
Implemented as part of the Assignment.
Implementation of a supervised learning algorithm which trains a multi-layer feed-forward network to correctly classify a set of images. The network uses a rectified linear activation function (ReLU). Its performance is measured on the subset of the EMNIST data set [1] and compared with the results achieved by Cohen et al. in “EMNIST: an extension of MNIST to handwritten letters” [2].


### Code
The neural network has been implemented as a separate class inside neural_network.py file.
To test it, please open the test.py file and comment/uncomment the lines for the experiment you'd like to test.
